# BfTree
Assignment 5 from Theory of Computation


This Java Program is capable of interpreting the Brain Fuck (BF) Programming language. 
From the following CFG which represents BF, we get the following first and follow sets
S → CS | LS | λ
Fi(S) ⊆ Fo(C), Fi(S) ⊆ Fo(L), Fo(S) ⊆ Fo(C), and Fo(S) ⊆ Fo(L)
The alphabet being {<, >, , , . , +, - [, ] }

The program constructs a parse tree based on the above
